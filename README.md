The "Flavi-Human_Shareome" file contains the mapping of shared sequences between flaviviruses and human proteomes. The mapping of the kmers (nonapeptides) 
shared sequences was done at 100% identity. It should be noted that the shared sequences in the mapped shareome were stored in the linearised AMONG format, 
(DRLPSALTA /V_sp|P29990.1|POLG_DEN26 0003167 /V_sp|P29991.1|POLG_DEN27 0003167 /H_EAW86531.1 0000611 /H_NP_001338206.1 0000626) with the flavivirus and human 
kmer metadata appended together without repeating the kmer sequence.

The catalogued flavi-human shareome serve as a starting point for various statistical, functional and structural analyses.
